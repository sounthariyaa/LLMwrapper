# Large Language Model (LLM) Wrapper

This repository contains a Python-based wrapper for interacting with pre-trained language models (LLMs) using the OpenAI API. It offers capabilities for both chat-based and completion-based tasks, simplifying the process of generating responses from LLMs.

## Installation

Before using the wrapper, ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install tiktoken
```


## Usage

To utilize the LLM wrapper, follow these steps:

1. Obtain your OpenAI API key and replace `API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.

2. Import the necessary classes and functions from the wrapper.

3. Initialize an instance of the `LLMWrapper` class, specifying the `model_type` ("Chat" or "Completion").

4. Create input messages or prompts based on the chosen model type.

5. Use the `generate_response` method to obtain model-generated responses.
   

**Example usage for chat-based model:**

```python
llm_wrapper = LLMWrapper(API_KEY, model_type="Chat")

messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello, how are you?"),
    ChatMessage(role="assistant", content="I'm doing well, thank you!")
]

response = llm_wrapper.generate_response(messages, max_tokens=100)
print("Generated Response:", response)

```
## Customization

You can adjust various parameters such as `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and memory usage in the wrapper. Refer to the code comments and the documentation for more details.
